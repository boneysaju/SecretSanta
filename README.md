#Secret Santa

## How to use the application

This application requires a minimum of 5 people to participate. Participants supply their name, email and postal address. They will then be randomly assigned as a secret santa to another participant and emailed with the details.

There are two methods to pair participants up and email them:

- CSV

- manual input

### CSV

Select option 1 from the first menu. There's a file in the top level project directory called:

> participants.txt

Add each participant to the file, one participant per line. Separate each field with a '/' and separate each line of the address with a ','.

### Manual Input

Select option 2 from the first menu and follow the displayed instructions.
